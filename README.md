# Machine-Learning
This is a set of Machine learning algorithms and Prediction models using various types of datasets such as UCI,Kaggle or from sklearn .
Here i have shown how to process data,visualize data, how to understand which factors are not important and trim them away from the dataset.
I have also shown how to find the accuracy and other metrics used to analyze datasets.
